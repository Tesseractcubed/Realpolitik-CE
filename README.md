# Realpolitik Community Edition
A modern overhaul to the Realpolitik software

Realpolitik is a Diplomacy viewer and adjudicator developed in the 2000s, 
and Realpolitik Community Edition (CE) hopes to be an overhauled version of the same software.

The overall goal of the Realpolitik CE project is straightforward:  
Create a capable way to play Diplomacy and Diplomacy variants.

Specific major goals for the project are as follows:
+ Support custom rulesets for variants
+ Support communities for tournaments and leagues
+ Support different platforms for play and communication

The technical arrangement of this project is many smaller modules that are called upon,
such that the overall structure is flexible to alterations. 
As such, the expected project structure is sets of modules, 
with each module representing a component that can be independently altered or replaced 
for different uses, say a unique variant mechanic.

This particular repository contains many of the collections for the the subcomponents.
